<p><b>Japan!</b> I love visiting it and have spent more than a year total traveling there.</p>

<p>I began learning Japanese at the age of thirteen and have since visited both as a city representative and as a student. The culture is always interesting to read up on, and I quickly fell in love with hiking and mountains while there.</p> 

<p>I miss the convenience, politeness, and scenery (both sights and smells) every day! Even the books smell different there. But would I want to go back forever? Eh...</p>
